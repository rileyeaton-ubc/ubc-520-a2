A table summarizing the measured performance of each data structure. Plots showing the run time complexity comparison. Comment on how the previous analysis holds up against the results. If the plots contradict the previous analysis, analyze them carefully: double check the implementation and review the analysis, provide justifications, and explain why this is happening.
